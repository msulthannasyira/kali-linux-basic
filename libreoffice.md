# Microsoft Office in Kali Linux! (LibreOffice)

You’ve got homework to write a story about your New Year’s holiday in a DOCX file, and it’s due tonight! Unfortunately, Kali Linux doesn’t come with a default application for creating this type of document. Or maybe you’re thinking of using Notepad—haha! Don’t worry; you can simply download LibreOffice. It’s fast, simple, and, most importantly, free!

## 1. Install LibreOffice

Use the following command to install LibreOffice

```cmd
sudo apt install libreoffice
```

## 2. Verify the installation

After the installation is complete, check the LibreOffice version to ensure it is installed correctly

```cmd
libreoffice --version
```

## 3. Launch LibreOffice

You can start LibreOffice by typing

```cmd
libreoffice 
```
or you can just open it directly from main menu
