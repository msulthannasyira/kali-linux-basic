# Kali Linux Basic
Hey there! So, I recently decided to dive into Kali Linux as my main OS, and I wanted to share my experience. If you're new to this OS, you might find it a bit overwhelming at first. But trust me, once you get the basics down, it’s not that bad!

When you first boot up Kali, there are a few key things you should do. For starters, updating the system is a must—otherwise, you might run into problems with old packages or missing updates. I also had to figure out how to set up my network and install a few tools to get the ball rolling.

If you’re interested, we can pulled together some notes and resources from our experience. I hope this helps anyone who's just starting out!
